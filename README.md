# fullscreencam

A Flutter/Dart application for showing the camera preview of your device.
It's using the Camera Plugin (https://pub.dev/packages/camera) with "Copyright 2017 The Chromium Authors. All rights reserved" (https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/packages/camera/LICENSE)

## Getting Started

Get Android Studio and the flutter- and dart-plugins. Now you should be able to build an APK (tested on Android only) to show just the camera preview in fullscreen.
